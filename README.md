# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews Dataset
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on the Amazon Reviews dataset using various machine learning models. The dataset consists of customer reviews from the Amazon e-commerce platform and is labeled with positive or negative sentiments.

In this project, we implement the following four models for sentiment analysis:

## Classical Machine Learning Models
Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

## BI-LSTM with Word2Vec/FastText Word Embedding

Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can capture contextual information effectively.
Word2Vec and FastText are popular word embedding techniques that represent words as dense vectors, capturing semantic meanings.
Transformer-Based Model with BERT-Based Word Embedding

## Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis.
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art pre-trained model that provides contextualized word embeddings.

### Dataset
The Amazon Reviews dataset used in this project contains a collection of customer reviews from the Amazon platform. Each review is labeled as either positive or negative sentiment.
